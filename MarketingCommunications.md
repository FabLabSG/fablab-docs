# Marketing and Communications

## Objectives

* Facilitate the smooth development and implementation of the project by keeping the key stakeholders engaged and updated across all phases.

* Attract community members and potential members to invite them to affiliate and participate of the community, its challenges and resources.

* Attract existing and future FabLabs to affiliate and offer their resources through FabLab Singapore (aka 'The Federation').

## Strategy

Given the relatively small size of the makers community in Singapore (probably in the few thousands), and that many of them are already engaged in some existing communities, we should prioritise the existing mechanisms of engagement.

At present, these communities interact mostly via Instagram and Facebook, so those should be the preferred channels.

The communication messages and channels should be tailored according to the audience and the phase of the project.

## Messages, audiences and channels
